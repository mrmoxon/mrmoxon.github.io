##Â Fundamentals of Life and Consciousness

I explore below the reductionist stories of life and consciousness, the origin of living organisms, fitness and natural selection, substrate-independent phenomena, and what all this means for us as a species. Warning. Not even a single joke, just purified madness.

1. The Story of Life

 

It is one thing to exist, and another thing to philosophise about it. 

 

To start from the basics, living matter arose from non-living matter between 3.5 and 4.28 billion years ago, soon-after the formation of oceans on planet Earth. We have no consensus over how, but the strongest hypothesis suggests a gradual process involving (1) autocatalytic reactions, (2) molecular self-replication, (3) molecular self-assembly, and (4) the emergence of cell membranes. 

 

Broadly speaking, life has two properties: 'survival' (metabolism and self-repair) and replication. All living organisms regenerate in accordance to their suitability to these parameters, thus possessing a 'fitness function' by nature. This regenerative process is Darwinian evolution. This function is synonymous to life as we know it, and is even what NASA use to define it "a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution". 

The power of this theory is such that in believing it to be true, other explanations, including divine design and extra-terrestrial origins, are replaceable. It states that for all species of organism, the reproductive process generates small variations in offspring, causing them to develop into 'fitter' species, more capable of surviving and reproducing in their environment. An organism's fitness determines its ability to produce offspring, and thus the process is cyclical; survival is granted only to those most fit. 

 

In 3 billion years, life advanced incrementally from single-celled (bacteria) to multi-cellular (plants, fungi) to protostomes and echinoderms, then fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and eventually mammals. This endless process of speciation is caused by species members being exposed to new conditions that impact their chance of survival.

 

A tree uses the sun, the air, and the soil, to catalyse their metabolic reactions. A tree's fitness score depends on their access to sunlight, and subsequently they use photoreceptors to grow towards the light. But their fitness score does not improve with high-resolution vision, like that of an eye. But for animals, who have no means to survive off radiation, air or soil alone, eyes are our most important feature; 90% of the human experience is devoted to our sense of sight. Eight different types of eye have evolved across the animal kingdom, each under different conditions. [1]

 

On a more micro scale, the observation that inspired Darwin's theory was the shape of finches' beaks in the Galapagos. He posited that their different beak shapes developed as members of the species developed different diets: from a single species of immigrant finch landing on the Galapagos islands, fourteen separate species evolved, each specialised by food preference, beak shape, and song.

It wasn't until 100 years after the publishing of Darwin's theory, however, that the biological evidence was discovered by Watson, Crick and Franklin in 1953. 'DNA' gives us the reductionist story of life itself.

 

But the plot thickens. As animals evolve, and their ability to generate and process information on their environments become more complex, a degree of 'wakingness' is produced. Some organisms become so complex that they not only can see their environment, but can feel it, hear it, smell it, and taste it. And not only that, but they can recognise patterns, make predictions, and plan ahead. Given sufficient generations, some mammals become so capable of thinking that they are can cooperate in large groups, build tools, and 'solve' their environment to suit their needs by growing food on-command for more efficient survival. 

Ultimately, hydrogen, given long enough, becomes self-aware.

 

Humankind uses science as a framework for understanding the mysteries of the universe; to determine our origins, and to discover the building block of ourselves: DNA. But one great mystery remains: there is no reductionist story of consciousness known yet to man. 

 

2. Understanding Substrate-Independence

 

This is about to get rather abstract. Bear with me. 

 

A crucial clue about the future of intelligence lies in the idea that there is a class of 'substrate-independent phenomena'. What does this mean? I'll use three examples. 

Waves are substrate-independent: wave speed, length, frequency, intensity, and all behaviour related to its identity can all be calculated without the need to know what matter the wave is passing through -- by use of Schrodinger's wave function.

Computations are substrate independent: any computer architecture is 'universal'; meaning it can perform the same exact computations with any matter arranged into logic gates -- proven by Alan Turing in 1950. [2] 

Another such phenomena is the conscious experience. A conscious character in a future computer game will have no way of knowing whether it is running on a desktop, tablet of phone; given their interface for reality is built out of matter, they cannot detect the architecture on which they run without drawing conclusions from their environment, in exactly the same way we cannot detect our own synapses, and only know about their exist by conducting scientific experiments on our environment. This is provable not by any formula (yet), but instead by one's own logic. [3]

These 'substrate-independent phenomena' are objectively fundamental to nature itself; the identity of waves, computations, and consciousness, are all definable without needing knowledge of the matter they exist in. For example, if two programmers are jointly hunting a bug in their code, they are probably not discussing the computational architecture, but the software and the outcome of their button-inputs. The computations behind the code could be done with integrated circuits, vacuum tubes, relays, or electromechanical boards and the programmers wouldn't even know without opening it up. 

There is trouble in defining such phenomena without creating jargon. I will call these curious, abstract, mystical phenomena "fundamentals". But what other fundamentals exist and how can we check? Why do we find them so inexplicable? And how can we use our understanding of fundamentals to change the way we view the universe? 

 

It appears that Einstein's 'spacetime' is insufficient in defining these fundamental concepts/things/forces. To that degree, there is much still to discover about reality. [4]

 

3. Why Substrate-Independence is a Big Deal For Us

 

What we are faced with (in plain English) is that the conscious experience does not arise from any particular arrangement of atoms, but from the dynamic process of their interaction. By nature of being substrate-independent, the specific makeup of proteins, enzymes, and cells in our body are not essential to our experience, and their behaviour can be emulated through any matter capable of facilitating this above-mentioned dynamic process of interaction. 

 

After the discovery of DNA, deciphering what it is that makes us human has been relatively straightforward: a focus on sequencing the human genome. There exists no such discovery for consciousness. Unfortunately, unlike waves and computations, exactly how this process of interaction works is still largely unknowable. This is partly because we lack an understanding of how to critically analyse it; progress is being made, but in an anarchy of methods. Consciousness is still a 'suitcase word', along with it cousins intelligence, thinking, cognitive, and emotion. [5]

 

However, there is light: the sheer fact that consciousness is substrate-independent means a number of significant things. 

 

	First, that it is possible that there are many forms of consciousness. 

If a conscious human mind is merely a complex system of electrochemical reactions and a conscious algorithm is merely a complex system of electrical current, then a complex system of kinetically charged particles, such as a thundercloud, could also be conscious. 

	On a larger scale, the biosphere is a complex, regulating system of energy so complex that it is teeming with conscious agents. Who is to say that the biosphere itself is not conscious? Arguably, Earth has a metabolism, a biosphere that self-repairs, and an ability to shed itself in the form of human astronauts, rocket payloads and debris. Those three components fit the definition of life we used so convincingly before. Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis is still of huge contention 50 years later. [6]

	Pushing scale to the limit, stars, solar systems, and galaxy clusters are all vastly more complex systems arbitrarily, and thus too could theoretically be waking. To prove this theory wrong, we will need to determine what it is exactly that guarantees consciousness and what prevents it. 

 

	Second, it is possible that humans can expand our own minds. 

Unlike life, which is either alive or dead, consciousness is malleable; it can be made more present or less present and yet still occur. The existence of brain implants prove that by biologically adding new sources of information into our cortex, the dynamic process of interaction can absorb the inputs and make them part of our experience. This is possibly the most exciting discovery ever.

	The human brain receives 11 million input bits per second. 10 million of those are visual. What would it be like to have new types of inputs from our eyes? Implants could enable us to read x-rays, radio waves, and microwaves. Implants could enhance the resolution of our vision until we could see any object's molecular arrangement or disturbances in gas particles. By understanding the parameters of our conscious experience, we can change them like dials in the settings menu, enhancing our reality.

	Equally, we can manipulate the surface on which the 'consciousness interaction' is maintained by implanting inorganic matter to the cortex, thus extending the lifetime of our minds indefinitely. 

 

The human brain is the most complex object in the universe. By understanding how it works, we can make it infinitely more complex and infinitely more effective at doing our bidding. And as we expand the human biological arena and lose our archaic subservience to the forces that once determined our survival, what our bidding is exactly will inevitably change.
